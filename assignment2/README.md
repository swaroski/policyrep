# Mod-3 FSM (Finite State Machine) 

Assignment-2 implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) that calculates the remainder when a binary number is divided by 3. It uses Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles with clean state separation and is extensible to support other FSMs. It also accounts for edge cases. 

## How It Works
The FSM uses three states (S0, S1, S2) representing the remainder of binary numbers modulo 3. The transitions are handled based on the current state and input bit (0 or 1).


### Run the FSM script
